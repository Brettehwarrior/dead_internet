    <h1>DEAD INTERNET</h1>
    <p>The Internet is dying. Where once distinct and rich communities flourished, only suffocating overcrowded superplatforms remain. The Internet is now a place where time wasted by the individual translates to capital in the pockets of a decaying oligopolistic frontier.</p>
    <p>The DEAD INTERNET is a reflection of a small slice of the Internet. The DEAD INTERNET can be experienced just like the rest of the Internet- Utilize scrolling, skimming, searching, and page navigation skills to get around the various pages. There is plenty to see, but the final objective will be obvious. You may miss some things- to have seen something is to have missed something else. Equally, luck be with you, you may find the conclusive page right away. The Internet is brimming with content, after all.</p>
    <p>Just like the real world Internet today, the front door to the DEAD INTERNET is <a href="y.html"><strong>social media</strong></a>.</p>
