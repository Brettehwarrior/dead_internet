    <h1>Yearn</h1>
    <p>I yearn for a time that I had once enjoyed</p>
    <p>The Internet and all its communities</p>
    <p>Which has become</p>
    <p>A Community.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One by one they arrived</p>
    <p>Offering friendship</p>
    <p>Offering connectivity untold</p>
    <p>Innocent smiles</p>
    <p>With sharpened FAANGs</p>
    <p>They became irreplacable</p>
    <p>And boiled us like the frogs we are.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hobbies discarded</p>
    <p>Friends lost</p>
    <p>Homes evicted and demolished</p>
    <p>We became Centralized.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the abscence of havens</p>
    <p>They cater to the Average Man</p>
    <p>Minimalist rounded corners</p>
    <p>Flat colors set the stage for the</p>
    <p>Sans-serif hellscape</p>
    <p>That Everyone can call home.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But proximity breeds resent</p>
    <p>We All became One</p>
    <p>In a way we were not programmed to do.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Watch the show;</p>
    <p>A frantic race to the bottom</p>
    <p>But you observe from within</p>
    <p>We are the content</p>
    <p>We are all along for the ride.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Something was lost</p>
    <p>In this brief history</p>
    <p>A DEAD INTERNET left in its wake.</p>
